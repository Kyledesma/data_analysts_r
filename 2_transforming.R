# There are six dplyr functions that you will use to do the vast majority of data manipulations:
# reorder the rows (arrange()),
# pick observations by their values (filter()),
# pick variables by their names (select()),
# create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()), or
# collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise()).
# These can all be used in conjunction with group_by() which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. These six functions provide the verbs for a language of data manipulation.
