# Teaching R for Data Analysts

## Motivation

These notes are meant to be a quick reference to get up and running with R and Rstudio. 
They are mainly designed for data analysts that want to get started quickly with R. The examples are adaptations that borrow heavily from [Hadley's R for Data Science Book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).
